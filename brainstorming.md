##NOTE: I am doing this after I have already spent the past 48 hours getting decently far along on my app, so brainstroming 6 other ideas feels kind of silly

but I will do it for the points:


1. Zookeeper Companion

Category: Zookeeping & Animal Education
Mobile: This app is a valuable tool for zookeepers, utilizing maps and location features to help them manage and track animals in the zoo. It provides real-time data on the animals' locations, health, and feeding schedules.
Story: The story is about enhancing the efficiency of zoo management, animal care, and conservation efforts. The value is evident for zookeepers and animal educators.
Market: The market includes zoo professionals, animal educators, and conservationists.
Habit: Zookeepers would frequently use the app for daily animal care and management tasks.
Scope: The technical challenge lies in real-time animal tracking. A basic version would still be helpful for zoo professionals.

2. Educational Nature Explorer

Category: Education & Environmental Studies
Mobile: The app is tailored for teachers and environmental educators, using location and real-time data to enhance nature education. It provides information about local ecosystems and wildlife for educational purposes.
Story: The story revolves around inspiring the next generation to appreciate and protect the environment. The app provides valuable teaching resources.
Market: The market includes teachers, environmental educators, and schools.
Habit: Teachers would frequently use the app to create engaging nature lessons for students.
Scope: The app's technical challenge is in collecting and presenting accurate educational content. A basic version is still valuable for educators.

3. School Event Manager

Category: Education & Event Planning
Mobile: This app is designed for teachers to manage school events efficiently. It utilizes location, push notifications, and real-time updates to coordinate and communicate with students, parents, and staff during events.
Story: The story is about simplifying school event organization, fostering community engagement, and improving event experiences. Teachers and school administrators benefit from its value.
Market: The market includes teachers, school administrators, and educational institutions.
Habit: Teachers would frequently use the app to plan and manage school events.
Scope: The app's technical challenge is in real-time communication and event logistics. A basic version is still useful for event management.

4. Russian Flash card app (the one I'm actually working on

Category: Education
Mobile: It is more than a glorified website because it allows you to do flashcards anywhere. I may add the ability to take photos and add them to the flashcards. I think this would be useful for those who do not have a Russian keyboard. The rest are not applicable though to the goals of the app
Story: For serious language learners this app is a huge time saver. I spend over 4 hours a day making and reviewing flashcards for my target languages, and so much of that time is spent searching for suitable sentences and new words. Thus the ability to get suggestions of high quality sentences and autofill translations would probably reduce my time spent by about an hour.
Market: Serious language learners or anyone learning Russian. The app works with any language, but the suggestions and autofill translations will only work with Russian. Also, the suggestions are more applicable for learners at the advanced level. Maybe later on I will find a corpus with simplier sentences and use it to make suitable suggestions for all levels
Habit: Most language learners use flashcard apps daily or close to daily. The idea is that since you are putting in the work to make the flashcards, you will use them frequently. But I might add some extra incentive like having the user set a goal for how many cards to review a day
Scope: I decided to start building the app before filling out the readme file just to get a sense for how achievable my goals will be. I would say I am about 1/3 of the way done with my app and am very confident in being able to get the rest of the 2/3rds done. If I am unable to connect my swift code to the python files, even a version with just the basic flashcards will still be a useful app.

5. Art Education Guide

Category: Arts & Culture Education
Mobile: This app serves as a guide for art teachers and educators. It uses location and real-time data to provide information about local art and cultural events, offering resources for educational field trips and art classes.
Story: The story is about enhancing art education, exposing students to local culture, and making art lessons more engaging. The app's value is clear for art educators.
Market: The market includes art teachers, educational institutions, and students.
Habit: Art educators would frequently use the app to plan art-related educational activities.
Scope: The app's technical challenge is in curating and presenting educational art content. A basic version is still valuable for educators.

6. Classroom Fitness Challenge
